# MicroVM Warm Pool Manager — Design

## Context

This project manages "warm pools" of pre-provisioned microVMs on top of
[flintlock](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/flintlock), so consumers can claim an
already-booted VM instantly instead of waiting for flintlock to provision one on demand.

Key grounding facts confirmed directly from the flintlock and guest-agent source (not assumed):

- Flintlock's `MicroVM` gRPC service (proto: `api/services/microvm/v1alpha1/microvms.proto`)
  exposes `CreateMicroVM`, `DeleteMicroVM`, `GetMicroVM`, `ListMicroVMs`, `ListMicroVMsStream`.
  There is **no watch/subscribe RPC** — `ListMicroVMsStream` streams the current list, it's not
  an event feed. Our pool manager must poll flintlock and derive its own state transitions/events.
- `MicroVMSpec` (proto: `api/types/microvm.proto`) has an `allow_guest_agent` bool field: when
  true, flintlock attaches a vsock device so the in-VM
  [guest-agent](https://github.com/liquidmetal-dev/guest-agent) can be reached. `MicroVMStatus`
  exposes `vsock_path` — the host-side Unix-domain-socket path for that vsock device (empty
  unless `allow_guest_agent` is set).
- The guest-agent listens on vsock with a small control protocol (exec/ping/info) and an ssh
  proxy. The host drives it via the `vsock-connect` CLI helper: `vsock-connect exec --uds
  <vsock_path> --port 1024 -- <cmd>` (exit code = command's exit code, stdout/stderr stream
  back), and `vsock-connect ping --uds <vsock_path> --port 1024` for liveness. The protocol
  internals aren't in an importable Go package (`internal/`), so the supported integration
  point is shelling out to the `vsock-connect` binary, not reimplementing the wire protocol.
- `MicroVMStatus.state` is `PENDING | CREATED | FAILED | DELETING`.
- Flintlock's own server (`internal/command/run/run.go`) supports gRPC with either TLS+mTLS-style
  cert auth or an explicit insecure mode (`cfg.TLS.Insecure`), plus optional basic auth, and
  exposes Prometheus metrics via `grpc_prometheus` + `promhttp`. We mirror this pattern.

## Decisions

- **Language**: Go.
- **Topology**: manage a fleet of multiple flintlock hosts (not just one).
- **Persistence**: embedded DB (SQLite), single active instance for v1 (no HA/leader-election yet;
  restart recovers state from disk).
- **Events**: delivered via a gRPC server-streaming subscription RPC (no webhooks/external bus for v1).
- **In-VM commands**: executed via flintlock's guest-agent vsock channel (`allow_guest_agent: true`
  is forced on for every pool-managed VM), not a custom bundled agent.
- **Replenishment**: each pool picks exactly **one** named strategy (not composable).
- **API auth**: support both mTLS and an explicit insecure (no-auth) mode, selectable in config.
- **Consumer identity**: opaque lease token returned by `ClaimVM`, presented on every
  heartbeat/release call — no tie to transport identity.
- **Heartbeat/expiry threshold**: configurable per-pool.
- **Failed create/pre-lease hook policy**: configurable per-pool — either (a) delete the VM and
  let replenishment provision a replacement, or (b) mark it unhealthy/quarantined and retain it
  for operator inspection.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions.
- **Release artifacts**: container image + cross-platform binaries via GoReleaser.
- **Deployment target**: deployment-agnostic (plain binary + container image); no k8s-specific
  assumptions baked into the design for v1.
- **Guest-agent reachability across hosts**: the guest-agent's `vsock_path` is a Unix-domain
  socket local to whichever flintlock host runs the VM — not network-reachable. Since the fleet
  spans multiple flintlock hosts, we run a small **per-host sidecar** (`poolmgr-hostagent`)
  alongside each `flintlockd` that proxies guest-agent `exec`/`ping` calls over gRPC back to the
  central pool manager. This keeps the pool manager itself single-instance/host-agnostic and
  avoids requiring shared filesystem access to `/run/flintlock/<uid>/guest-agent.vsock`.
- **Minimum flintlock version**: v0.15.2. Earlier versions put the guest-agent socket under
  `<state-dir>/<namespace>/<name>/<uid>/`, where a long namespace or VM name could exceed the
  107-byte Unix socket path limit. The reconciler checks each host's version via `ServerInfo`
  before provisioning on it.

### Components

- **API Server** — gRPC server implementing four services: `PoolAdmin`, `Lease`, `Events`, and `HostAdmin`. TLS mode (mTLS or
  insecure) is a startup config choice, matching flintlock's own `--tls-insecure` pattern.
- **Reconciler** — one control loop per pool (goroutine), driven by a ticker plus event
  triggers (VM claimed, VM deleted). Responsible for: comparing desired vs actual pool state,
  invoking the configured replenishment strategy, running create/pre-lease hooks on new VMs
  before marking them `Available`, and sweeping expired leases.
- **Flintlock Client Pool** — holds a gRPC client per registered flintlock host (dialled from
  the store at startup, and changed at runtime by the `HostAdmin` API); the reconciler picks a
  host for each new VM using a simple placement policy (see Scheduling).
- **poolmgr-hostagent** (new small component, one instance per flintlock host) — a thin gRPC
  server, colocated with `flintlockd`, that receives `WaitReady(vsock_path)` /
  `Run(vsock_path, cmd)` calls from the pool manager and executes them locally by shelling out
  to `vsock-connect` (`ping` / `exec --uds <vsock_path> --port 1024`). This is the only
  component that needs local filesystem access to `/run/flintlock/*.vsock`.
- **Guest-Agent Client** (in the pool manager) — calls the appropriate host's
  `poolmgr-hostagent` (matched via the VM's `flintlock_host`) for `WaitReady`/`Run`. Used for
  both the creation hook and the pre-lease hook.
- **Store** — SQLite via a small repository layer; also holds an events "outbox" table so
  `EventsService.Subscribe` can replay recent events to a newly-connected subscriber and so
  event emission survives a crash between "decided to emit" and "delivered."
- **Metrics** — `/metrics` HTTP endpoint (Prometheus format), instrumented at the reconciler
  and API layer (see Metrics section).

### Multi-host fleet & scheduling (v1 scope)

Flintlock hosts are records in the store (name, address, TLS file paths, cordon state), managed
at runtime through the `HostAdmin` API (`poolmgrctl host add|update|remove|cordon`) rather than
listed in the config file; see [the host API ADR](../adr/2026-09-24-host-api.md). A fresh
manager has no hosts until one is added. Resource capacity is not tracked in v1 beyond a simple
least-loaded-by-VM-count placement across the hosts eligible for a pool. Each pool
definition lists which flintlock host(s) it's allowed to place VMs on, and each must already be
registered. A pool's VMs can span multiple hosts, and cordoned hosts are skipped. No cross-pool
bin-packing or live host capacity probing in v1 — this keeps scheduling simple and is an
explicit place to extend later (e.g. querying host resource usage) without changing the
external API.

## Data Model

**PoolSpec** (persisted; admin-managed):
- `name`, `namespace`
- `microvm_template`: a `flintlock.types.MicroVMSpec` template (vcpu, memory, kernel, volumes,
  interfaces, labels, metadata) — `allow_guest_agent` is always forced `true` server-side.
  The rest of the template is sent to flintlock unchanged for every VM, so an interface's
  `guest_mac` or static `address` would be shared by all of them. `CreatePool`/`UpdatePool`
  reject a template that sets either with `InvalidArgument`, unless the pool never holds two
  VMs at once: `size` at most 1, a strategy other than `IMMEDIATE_ON_LEASE` (which provisions
  on every claim without counting leased VMs) and a `hook_failure_policy` other than
  `QUARANTINE` (which keeps the failed VM, and nothing but deleting the pool removes it). Any
  other pool must leave both unset, so flintlock generates the MAC and the guest uses DHCP.

  The spec alone doesn't guarantee a single VM, so the reconciler also enforces it: for a
  template with static network config it provisions at most one VM, and only when the pool
  has no VM record left in any phase. This covers a VM that is still `DELETING` after a slow
  or failed flintlock delete, a pool shrunk to `size: 1` that still has its old VMs, and a
  pool stored before the rule existed (it is kept to one VM rather than rejected; a stored
  `QUARANTINE` pool stops replenishing once it holds a quarantined VM). Not enforced:
  - addresses configured through the template's cloud-init `metadata` are not inspected;
  - a VM being provisioned by the previous reconciler when `UpdatePool` restarts it has no
    VM record until flintlock accepts it, so the new reconciler can't see it in that window.
- `size`: target pool size
- `flintlock_hosts`: list of eligible host identifiers
- `replenishment_strategy`: enum `IMMEDIATE_ON_LEASE | MIN_SIZE_THRESHOLD | REPLACE_ON_DELETE`
  (+ strategy-specific params, e.g. `min_size` threshold)
- `create_commands`: []string — run once after boot + guest-agent ready
- `pre_lease_commands`: []string — run immediately before a claim is handed to a consumer
- `hook_failure_policy`: enum `DELETE_AND_REPLACE | QUARANTINE`
- `heartbeat_interval`, `heartbeat_expiry_threshold` (durations)

**VMRecord** (per-VM state owned by the pool manager, cross-referenced with flintlock's own
`MicroVMStatus` by UID):
- `uid` (flintlock UID), `pool_name`, `pool_namespace` (together identify the owning pool, as
  `PoolRef` does), `flintlock_host`
- `phase`: `PROVISIONING → CREATE_HOOK_RUNNING → AVAILABLE → LEASED → PRE_LEASE_HOOK_RUNNING
  (transient, before handing to consumer) → DELETING` / `QUARANTINED` / `FAILED`
- `lease_id` (nullable), timestamps

**Lease**:
- `lease_id` (opaque token, returned from `ClaimVM`), `vm_uid`, `pool_name`, `pool_namespace`
- `claimed_at`, `last_heartbeat_at`, `expires_at` (computed from pool's threshold)

**Event** (outbox row): `id`, `pool_name`, `pool_namespace`, `vm_uid`, `type`, `payload`,
`created_at`.
Event types: `VMProvisioned`, `VMAvailable`, `VMClaimed`, `VMReleased`,
`VMExpiringSoon` (optional pre-warning), `VMDeletedDueToExpiry`, `VMDeletedOnRelease`,
`VMHookFailed`, `PoolReplenishing`, `PoolSizeBelowTarget`.

## gRPC API (sketch)

```proto
service PoolAdmin {
  rpc CreatePool(CreatePoolRequest) returns (Pool);
  rpc UpdatePool(UpdatePoolRequest) returns (Pool);
  rpc DeletePool(DeletePoolRequest) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
  rpc GetPool(GetPoolRequest) returns (Pool);
  rpc ListPools(ListPoolsRequest) returns (ListPoolsResponse);
}

service Lease {
  rpc ClaimVM(ClaimVMRequest) returns (ClaimVMResponse);       // returns lease_id + VM connection info
  rpc Heartbeat(HeartbeatRequest) returns (HeartbeatResponse); // keyed by lease_id
  rpc ReleaseVM(ReleaseVMRequest) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
}

service Events {
  rpc Subscribe(SubscribeRequest) returns (stream Event); // optional pool_name filter
}
```

`ClaimVMResponse` returns enough for the consumer to reach the VM (IP/interfaces from flintlock's
`MicroVMStatus.network_interfaces`) plus the `lease_id`. `ClaimVM` fails with a distinct status
(e.g. `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`) when no VM is `AVAILABLE`.

`ClaimVMRequest.request_id` makes `ClaimVM` safe to retry: while the lease it created exists, a
repeat request with the same `request_id` returns that lease rather than claiming another VM.
See the [idempotent claims ADR](../adr/2026-09-24-idempotent-claims.md).

## Lease Lifecycle

1. Consumer calls `ClaimVM(pool_name)`. Manager atomically picks an `AVAILABLE` VM, runs the
   pool's `pre_lease_commands` via the guest-agent client (state → `PRE_LEASE_HOOK_RUNNING`),
   then transitions to `LEASED`, creates a `Lease` row, emits `VMClaimed`, decrements
   available count.
   - If `IMMEDIATE_ON_LEASE` strategy: reconciler is nudged immediately to top the warm set
     back up to `size`.
2. Consumer periodically calls `Heartbeat(lease_id)`; updates `last_heartbeat_at`/`expires_at`.
3. Release happens via:
   - explicit `ReleaseVM(lease_id)` call, or
   - the expiry sweeper finding `now > expires_at` with no recent heartbeat.
   Either path: emit `VMExpiringSoon` (sweeper path, fired once, before the deadline — window
   configurable) → then on actual expiry/release, delete the VM via flintlock, emit
   `VMDeletedOnRelease`/`VMDeletedOnExpiry`, delete the `Lease` row.
   - If `REPLACE_ON_DELETE` strategy: reconciler is nudged immediately to top the pool back
     up to `size` VMs in total.

## Replenishment Strategies

- `IMMEDIATE_ON_LEASE`: keep `size` available VMs, leased VMs being extra. Every successful
  claim immediately triggers a top-up.
- `MIN_SIZE_THRESHOLD`: reconciler loop checks available count against `min_size`; when below,
  provisions up to `size`.
- `REPLACE_ON_DELETE`: keep `size` VMs in total, leased included. Every VM deletion (expiry,
  release-triggered, or hook failure) immediately triggers a top-up.

All three strategies are level-triggered: when a pool's reconciler starts (manager startup,
`CreatePool`, `UpdatePool`) and on every tick, it counts the pool's VMs and provisions the whole
shortfall against the strategy's target, rather than a fixed number per event. This is what fills
a fresh, empty pool, where nothing can be claimed or deleted yet, and what recovers a pool after
a provision fails or every host was cordoned: the next tick finds the pool still short and tries
again.

The two event-driven strategies also run that same top-up on a notification, a claim for
`IMMEDIATE_ON_LEASE` and a delete for `REPLACE_ON_DELETE`, so it happens sooner than the next
tick. Several notifications coalescing into one therefore lose nothing. `MIN_SIZE_THRESHOLD`
ignores notifications and acts only at start and on ticks.

A VM whose claim is still in progress (its pre-lease hook is running, or its lease isn't
committed yet) counts toward every strategy's total, including the warm set of
`IMMEDIATE_ON_LEASE`: it is replaced only once the lease commits, since until then the claim can
still hand the VM back. A claim can't stay in progress across a restart: on startup, before any
reconciler runs, the manager marks every VM that is claimed with no lease for deletion, so a
claim abandoned by a crash doesn't hold a place in the pool forever.

A VM in `DELETING` counts toward no strategy's total, so a `REPLACE_ON_DELETE` tick can start the
replacement before the old VM's deletion completes. A failing provision is retried on every tick
with no backoff.

All strategies share the same provisioning pipeline: `CreateMicroVM` (flintlock) → poll
`GetMicroVM` until `CREATED` with a non-empty `vsock_path` → guest-agent `WaitReady` → run
`create_commands` → on success mark `AVAILABLE` + emit `VMAvailable`; on failure apply the
pool's `hook_failure_policy`.

## Metrics (Prometheus, `/metrics`)

Per-pool gauges/counters (labeled by `pool_name`):
- `poolmgr_pool_size` (target), `poolmgr_pool_available`, `poolmgr_pool_leased`,
  `poolmgr_pool_provisioning`, `poolmgr_pool_quarantined`
- `poolmgr_vm_claims_total{replayed="true|false"}`, `poolmgr_vm_releases_total{reason="api|expiry"}`
- `poolmgr_vm_provision_duration_seconds` (histogram), `poolmgr_hook_duration_seconds{hook="create|pre_lease"}`
- `poolmgr_hook_failures_total{hook,pool_name}`
- `poolmgr_lease_duration_seconds` (histogram)

Plus standard gRPC server metrics via `grpc_prometheus` interceptors, matching flintlock's own
convention.

## Storage Schema (SQLite, outline)

Tables: `pools`, `vms`, `leases`, `events`. Reconciler and API handlers go through a repository
interface (`internal/store`) so SQLite can later be swapped without touching business logic.
`events` table doubles as the outbox for `Events.Subscribe` (new subscribers get recent
unacked rows replayed, keyed by a monotonic id per pool).

## Repo Layout (target shape)

```
/cmd/poolmgrd              — server entrypoint
/cmd/poolmgr-hostagent      — per-flintlock-host sidecar entrypoint
/api/proto/poolmgr/v1alpha1 — our own .proto definitions (PoolAdmin/Lease/Events/hostagent)
/internal/reconciler        — per-pool control loop, replenishment strategies
/internal/flintlockclient   — thin wrapper over generated flintlock gRPC client, one per host
/internal/guestagent        — hostagent gRPC client (WaitReady/Run), used by pool manager
/internal/hostagent         — hostagent gRPC server impl (wraps vsock-connect locally)
/internal/store             — SQLite repository (pools, vms, leases, events)
/internal/api               — gRPC service implementations
/internal/server            — API server construction: TLS/mTLS creds + optional basic-auth
/internal/config            — config loading, TLS setup (mirrors flintlock's cmdflags pattern)
/deploy                     — Dockerfile, example k8s manifests (non-binding)
/.github/workflows          — ci.yml (lint/test/build), release.yml (goreleaser on tag)
/.goreleaser.yaml
```

## Testing/Verification Approach

- Unit tests per package (reconciler strategies, lease expiry logic, store repository) using
  Go's standard testing + an in-memory/temp-file SQLite DB.
- A fake flintlock gRPC server (implementing the same `MicroVM` service interface) for
  reconciler integration tests, so tests don't require a real flintlock/Firecracker host.
- A fake guest-agent client interface for hook-running tests (no real vsock needed).
- CI (`ci.yml`): `go build`, `go vet`, `golangci-lint`, `go test ./...` on PRs.
- Manual/E2E verification (documented, not automated in v1): run against a real flintlockd +
  Firecracker VM with `allow_guest_agent: true` and confirm `MicroVMExec.ExecCommand`/
  `MicroVMSSHProxy.SSHProxy` work end-to-end, confirm claim/heartbeat/release/expiry flow
  end-to-end, confirm `/metrics` and `Events.Subscribe` reflect real transitions. See
  [`docs/runbooks/e2e-manual-verification.md`](../runbooks/e2e-manual-verification.md) for the
  step-by-step runbook.

## Open Items Deferred Past v1 (explicitly out of scope)

- HA/multi-replica pool manager (leader election or shared DB).
- Cross-pool bin-packing / real host resource-aware scheduling.
- Webhook/external event sinks (only gRPC streaming subscription in v1).
- Kubernetes-native packaging (CRDs/operator) — plain binary/container only.
